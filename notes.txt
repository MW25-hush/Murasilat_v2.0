1: I think i should make a central type file and then export everything from there
2: the suspend is still not working for the login page 
3: the placeholder in the react quill is not working 
4: the lang props and useEffect all over the place just for the same purpose so they should be used as a custom hook
5: add draft option to the side bar archive
